**Changed:**

* Changed the build_steps.sh template so that it sets the number of maximum file
  descriptors to 1024. This is done to mitigate a bug in old rpm versions (such
  as the one shipped with the Centos7 container) that cause the yum install step
  to take tremendously longer than necessary. See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1537564 (#1960) (#1961)
