**Added:**

* Added key `travis_linux_aarch64_instance` to specify the use of Graviton 2 for AArch64 Linux builds On Travis CI, which according to Amazon should make builds up to two-times faster than the Travis default. The instance also comes in a large size that should allow us to build packages that currently timeout or results in OOM errors. Compared to the medium instance, the large doubles vCPUs from 2 to 4 and increases RAM from 7.5 GB to ~16GB.
