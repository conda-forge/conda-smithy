Overview
--------

`conda-smithy` is a tool for combining a conda recipe with configurations to build using freely hosted CI services into a single repository, also known as a feedstock.
`conda-smithy` is still a work-in-progress, but when complete, `conda-smithy` will:

+ Create a git repo with a conda recipe and the files to run conda builds via CI
  services.
+ Register the repo on github and push it.
+ Connect the repo to the CI services travis-ci.org, appveyor.com, circleci.com

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install conda-smithy is to use conda and conda-forge:

```
conda install -n root -c conda-forge conda-smithy
```

To install conda-smithy from source, see the requirements file in `requirements.txt`, clone this
repo, and `python setup.py install`.

Setup
-----

You need a token from github, travis-ci.org, appveyor.com and circleci.com to try out
`conda-smithy`. The commands which need this will tell you where to get these tokens and where to
place them. If you need help getting tokens please ask on the
[conda-forge google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/conda-forge).

You should be able to test parts of `conda-smithy` with whatever tokens you have.
For example, you should be able to `conda smithy register-github` without the CI service tokens.

Re-rendering an existing feedstock
----------------------------------

Periodically feedstocks need to be upgraded to include new features. To do
this we use `conda-smithy` to go through a process called re-rendering.
Make sure you have installed `conda-smithy` before proceeding.

1. `cd <feedstock directory>`
2. `conda smithy rerender [--commit]`
3. Commit and push all changes

Optionally one can commit the changes automatically with `conda-smithy` version `1.4.1+`.
To do this just use the `--commit`/`-c` option. By default this will open an editor to make a commit.
It will provide a default commit message and show the changes to be added. If you wish to do this
automatically, please just use `--commit auto`/`-c auto` and it will use the stock commit message.

Making a new feedstock
----------------------

1. **Make the feedstock repo:** `conda smithy init
<directory_of_conda_recipe>`.     For a recipe called `foo`, this creates a
directory called `foo-feedstock`, populates it with CI setup skeletons, adds the recipe under
`recipe` and initializes it as a git repo.
2. **Create a github repo:** `conda smithy register-github --organization conda-forge ./foo-feedstock`.
This requires a github token. You can try it out with a github user account
instead of an organization by replacing the organization argument with
`--user github_user_name`. If you are interested in adding teams for your feedstocks,
you can provide the `--add-teams` option to create them. This can be done when creating
the feedstock or after.
3. **Register the feedstock with CI services:**
`conda smithy register-ci --organization conda-forge --feedstock_directory ./foo-feedstock`.
This requires tokens for the CI services. You can give the name of a user instead
of organization with `--user github_user_name`.
4. **Specify the feedstock channel and label:**
Optionally, you can choose a channel to upload to in `conda-forge.yml`.
  ```
  channels:
    targets:
      - [target_channel, target_label]
  ```
  Default is `[conda-forge, main]`.
  
5. **Re-render the feedstock:** ``conda smithy rerender --feedstock_directory ./foo-feedstock``
6. **Commit the changes:** ``cd foo-feedstock && git commit``, then push ``git push upstream master``.

Running a build
---------------

When everything is configured you can trigger a build with a push to the feedstock repo on github.
