**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Min RK



v3.6.7
====================

**Added:**

Non-noarch recipes shouldn't use version constraints on python and r-base. 
The linter only checked for python, this PR addes the check for r-base.
* Added an option to skip adding webhooks

**Fixed:**

* Azure builds for OSX and Windows only attempt to upload if builds succeeded
  and the BINSTAR_TOKEN is available.

**Authors:**

v3.6.6
====================

**Added:**

* ``conda smithy rerender`` now adds an automerge action if ``conda-forge.yml`` has ``bot: {automerge: True}`` set.
  This action merges PRs that are opened by the ``regro-cf-autotick-bot``, are passing, and have the ``[bot-automerge]``
  slug in the title.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed problems rendering the ``README.md`` for some ``Jinja2`` variables (#1215)

**Authors:**

* Christopher J. Wright
* Matthew R Becker
* Matthew R. Becker



v3.6.5
====================

**Added:**

* Added ``.gitignore`` entries when running ``ci-skeleton``.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed Jinja syntax error in ``ci-skeleton``.

**Authors:**

* Anthony Scopatz



v3.6.4
====================

**Added:**

* New ``conda smithy ci-skeleton`` subcommand that generates ``conda-forge.yml``
  and ``recipe/meta.yaml`` files for using conda-forge / conda-smithy as
  the CI configuration outside of configuration. Calling ``rerender`` after
  ``ci-skeleton`` will generate the configuration files. This is a great way to
  either bootstrap CI for a repo or continue to keep CI up-to-date.
  The ``recipe/meta.yaml`` that is generated is just a stub, and will need to
  be filled out for CI to properly build and test.

**Fixed:**

* Fix an issue with empty host
* Fix python lint for recipes with outputs



v3.6.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added a lint for common mistakes in python requirements
* Use shellcheck to lint ``*.sh`` files and provide findings as hints. Can be
  enabled via conda-forge.yaml (shellcheck: enabled: True), default (no entry)
  is False.
* Support aarch64 on travis-ci.com
* Support ppc64le on travis-ci.com
* Check that the current working directory is a feedstock before re-rendering.

**Changed:**

* Update travis feedstock registration to no longer generate anything for
travis-ci.org.



v3.6.2
====================

**Changed:**

* Changed the pipeline names in drone to less than 50 characters
* .scripts folder is also hidden in PR diffs

**Fixed:**

* Fixed a bug in configuring appveyor.yml



v3.6.1
====================

v3.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* Ignore Drone CI files in GitHub diffs
* Run ``black --check`` on CI to verify code is formatted correctly

**Changed:**

* Platform independent files like `run_docker_build.sh` are moved to `.scripts` folder
* Standardize and test support for multiple docker images.
* refactored ``conda_smithy.lint_recipe.NEEDED_FAMILIES`` to top level so external projects can access
* Rerun ``black`` on the codebase.

**Fixed:**

* fix crash when host section was present but empty
* fix build-locally.py in skip_render by not attempting to chmod +x it
* ship conf file for black so everyone uses the same settings



v3.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* conda-smithy will remove the ``.github/CODEOWNERS`` file in case the recipe
  maintainers list is empty

* Check that a project is registered if registering fails on drone
* Check that a project has the secret if adding secret fails on drone

  architecture builds.

**Changed:**

* drone.io is now the default platform for aarch64 builds
* migrations folder changed from <feedstock_root>/migrations to <feedstock_root>/.ci_support/migrations

**Fixed:**

* YAML ``dump()`` now used ``pathlib.Path`` object.



v3.4.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Updated conda-smithy to work with ruamel.yaml v0.16+.



v3.4.3
====================

**Changed:**

* In linting pins allow more than one space

**Fixed:**

* Don't lint setting build number



v3.4.2
====================

**Added:**

* Generating feedstocks with support for the linux-armv7l platform.
* test of the downgrade functionality of the new pinning system
* Mark generated files as generated so that github collapses them by deafult in diffs.
* The linter will now recomend fixes for malformed pins,
  suggesting a single space is inserted. For instance, both ``python>=3`` and
  ``python >= 3`` will ought to be ``python >=3``.
* New key ``upload_on_branch`` added to conda-forge.yml the value of which is checked
  against the current git branch and upload will be skipped if they are not equal.
  This is optional and an empty key skips the test.
* Added `CONDA_SMITHY_LOGLEVEL` environment variable to change verbosity
  of rendering. This can be either `debug` or `info`.

**Changed:**

**Changed:**

* ``build-locally.py`` now uses ``python3`` even if ``python`` is ``python2`` (Python 3.6+ was already required)

**Removed:**

* Github issue, PR and contributing files are removed as they are in https://github.com/conda-forge/.github
* Support for python 2 Removed

**Fixed:**

* Fixed checking in .pyc files



v3.3.6
====================

**Fixed:**

* Indentation error in ``github.py``



v3.3.5
====================

**Added:**

* Added native aarch64 support for builds using Drone.io. This can be enabled by
  either using `provider: {linux_aarch64: drone}` or `provider: {linux_aarch64:
  native}` in the conda-forge.yml.
  
  Currently, drone has to be enabled manually as there is no automatic CI
  registration for repos.
* export CI env variable with CI provider name
* New ``build-locally.py`` script that is added to the root feedstock directory when
  ``conda smithy rerender`` is run. This script runs conda build locally. Currently

* build setup script overriding is now supported on azure too



v3.3.4
====================



v3.3.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added native ppc64le support to for travis-ci.  This can be enabled by either using
  `provider: {linux_ppc64le: travis}` or `provider: {linux_ppc64le: native}` in the conda-forge.yml.
  These will be the new default behavior going forward for ppc64le builds.  If native builds are not needed the 
  qemu based builds on azure will continue to function as before.
* Added `DOCKER_IMAGE` variable to `run_docker_build.sh`

**Changed:**

* Fallback to default image in `run_docker_build.sh` if `shyaml` is not installed.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed badges for noarch builds using azure



v3.3.2
====================

**Fixed:**

* Use `config.instance_base_url` instead of `config.azure_team_instance` when creating new feedstocks



v3.3.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a utility to retrieve the azure buildid.  This is needed to make badges for non-conda forge users.
* Added badges for azure ci builds.

* Switched default provider for osx and linux to be azure.
* ``conda-smithy regenerate`` now supports ``--check`` to see if regeneration can be performed

* Only suggest noarch in linting staged-recipes pull requests, not feedstocks.
  Refer to issues #1021, #1030, #1031. Linter is not checking all prerequisites for noarch.

====================

**Fixed:**

* Secrets weren't getting passed to Azure properly.



v3.2.10
====================

**Changed:**

These in particular are: ``cdt_arch``, ``cdt_name``,  ``BUILD``.



v3.2.9

v3.2.8

    .. code-block:: yaml

    idle_timeout_minutes: 30
None

* Added preliminary multiarch builds for aarch64 and ppc64le using qemu on azure.  This will be enabled by

`--without-travis`, and `--without-appveyor` can now be used in conjunction with
`conda smithy register-ci`.

**Changed:**

conda-build is now specified along side `conda-forge-ci-setup` installs so that it gets updated to the latest version available during each build.
* Moved NumFOCUS badge to "About conda-forge" section in the feedstock README.

v3.2.0
====================

**Changed:**

* updated toolchain lint to error


**Fixed:**
