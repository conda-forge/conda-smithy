v3.28.0
====================

**Added:**

* For self-hosted github actions runs, a user can add custom labels
  by adding `github_actions_labels` yaml key in `recipe/conda_build_config.yaml`.

  and the value `self-hosted` can be used for the default self-hosted labels.

* `github_actions: timeout_minutes` option added to change the timeout in minutes.
  The default value is `360`.

* `github_actions: triggers` is a list of triggers which defaults to
  `push, pull_request` when not self-hosted and `push` when self-hosted.

* Added a `--cirun` argument to `conda-smithy ci-register` command to register
  `cirun` as a CI service. This makes `cirun` conda package a dependency of
  conda-smithy.

* Added support for `cirun` by generating a unique label when the self-hosted
  label starts with `cirun`.

* When a label is added that has the string with `gpu` or `GPU` for a self-hosted
  runner, the docker build will pass the GPUs to the docker instance.
* Add ``flow_run_id`` (CI provider specific), ``remote_url`` and ``sha`` as extra-meta data to packages.
  Enables tracing back packages to a specific commit in a feedstock and to a specific CI run.
  When packages are built using ``build-locally.py`` only ``sha`` will have a non-empty value.
  Requires ``conda-build >=3.21.8``. (#1577)

**Changed:**

* `github_actions: cancel_in_progress` option added to cancel in progress runs.
  The default value was changed to `true`.
* Use the channels defined in `conda_build_config.yaml` (instead of those in `conda-forge.yml`) to render `README.md`. (#897 via #1752, #1785)
*  Allow finer control over Azure disk cleaning ( #1783 )
* The default build tool changed from conda-mambabuild to conda-build with
  libmamba solver.

* Windows CI on azure uses python 3.10 in the base environment.
* Replaced deprecated use of ::set-output during conda artifact storage on GitHub Actions with the recommended redirect to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. See https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/.
* Default branch for github is now ``main`` instead of ``master``.
* Changed python packaging to use setuptools-scm instead of versioneer.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Johnny Willemsen
* Marcel Bargull
* Marius van Niekerk
* Brandon Andersen



v3.21.2
====================

**Changed:**

* ``conda-smithy`` will not check which ``conda`` version is installed anymore.
  ``conda`` follows CalVer now, which does not provide information about API guarantees,
  thus rendering this check moot.

**Fixed:**

* Fix ``pyproject.toml`` derived issues with CI tests

**Authors:**

* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra



v3.21.1
====================

**Changed:**

* macOS jobs provided by Azure Pipelines will now use the ``macOS-11`` VM image (#1645).

**Fixed:**

* Fix spurious lint when using pin_subpackage or pin_compatible with a build string

**Authors:**

* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra
* Min RK



v3.21.0
====================

**Added:**

* All conda packages will have the license file included alongside
  the rendered recipe.
* conda-smithy now reports lint if pin_compatible or pin_subpackage are used
  with the wrong package type.

**Changed:**

* build_locally now creates conda's shared package cache outside the container,
  so repeated builds of the same recipe do not need to redownload packages.
* ``mamba`` is now used in the CI tests for conda-smithy

**Fixed:**

* Fix the support of `idle_timeout_minutes` for Travis CI

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker
* Leo Fang
* Tim Snyder
* Daniel Ching
* Nicholas Bollweg

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Tim Snyder
* Nicholas Bollweg



v3.19.0
====================

**Added:**

* noarch packages that cannot be built on ``linux_64`` can be configured to build
  on one or more ``noarch_platforms`` in ``conda-forge.yml``

**Changed:**

* Default provider for aarch64 and pcp64le is now Travis-CI

**Fixed:**

* Travis CI badge in readme uses correct url and linux image

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker
* Nicholas Bollweg
* Sylvain Corlay



v3.18.0
====================

**Deprecated:**

* We have deprecated the usage of Travis CI for any platforms but linux_aarch64, linux_ppc64le, or
  linux_s390x. Conda-smithy will raise a RuntimeError if one attempts to render a recipe for a different platform.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed rotation token for gha
* Fixed a bug where mpich and openmpi pins were not appearing properly due non-recursive parsing in smithy.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker

* Fixed bug where remote ci setup removed boa too.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker



v3.17.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fixed issue with CLI argument for feedstock token commands.

**Authors:**

* Mervin Fansler



v3.17.0
====================

**Added:**

* When rotating tokens, update the token in GHA too
* The variable 'BUILD_WITH_CONDA_DEBUG' (and thus build-locally.py's '--debug' flag) is now honored on macOS.
* Users may now specify a list of packages as part of the ``remote_ci_setup``
  entry in ``conda-forge.yml`` to install more packages as part of the setup
  phase.

**Changed:**

* Drop ``defaults`` from ``channel_sources``
* The SPDX identifier list has been updated.
* Updated ``.ci_support/README`` for improved clarity.

**Fixed:**

Fixed a bug in run_docker_build.sh when finding the value of FEEDSTOCK_ROOT.
In some cases the cd command had output to stdout which was included in
FEEDSTOCK_ROOT. Now the value is computed as for THISDIR in the same script,
with the output of cd redirected to /dev/null.
*Clarify in build-locally.py that setting OSX_SDK_DIR implies agreement to the SDK license.
* Added .ci_support/README to generated file list

**Authors:**

* Matthew R. Becker



v3.16.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added rerendering token input to webservices github action and automerge github action.

**Authors:**

* Matthew R. Becker



v3.15.1
====================

**Added:**

* Added a hint for recipes in conda-forge to depend on matplotlib-base as opposed to
  matplotlib.

**Changed:**

* use python 3.9 on github actions and use mambaforge
* When building with boa, use mamba to install conda-build, etc.  This assumes that
  we are using a Mambaforge based docker image / runtime environment.
* For azure pipelines, the default windows image is changed to windows-2019

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker
* Marius van Niekerk



v3.15.0
====================

**Added:**

* Conda smithy will now detect if a recipe uses ``compiler('cuda')``
and set the ``CF_CUDA_ENABLED`` environment variable to ``True`` if
so. This can for example be useful to distinguish different options
for builds with or without GPUs in ``conda_build_config.yaml``.
* Introduce utility function to facilitate the use case of running conda smithy
  commands from any sub-directory in the git repo checkout of a feedstock.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed typo in GitHub Actions template, where ``DOCKERIMAGE`` was wrongly specified in the matrix configuration. The CI step and its corresponding script expect ``DOCKER_IMAGE``.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra
* H. Vetinari
* Nehal J Wani



v3.14.3
====================

**Changed:**

* linux-aarch64 builds default is changed from native (drone) to emulated (azure).

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Mike Taves



v3.14.2
====================

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando



v3.14.2
====================

**Added:**

* Download SDK to local folder when build-locally.py instead of to the system dir
* Added support for woodpecker CI support

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando



v3.14.1
====================

**Fixed:**

* Call ``docker pull`` then ``docker run`` (sometimes ``--pull`` is unavailable)

**Authors:**

* Matthew R. Becker
* John Kirkham



v3.14.0
====================

**Added:**

* ``test`` option in ``conda-forge.yml`` can now be used to configure testing.
  By default testing is done for all platforms. ``native_and_emulated`` value
  will do testing only if native or if there is an emulator. ``native`` value
  will do testing only if native.

**Deprecated:**

* ``test_on_native_only`` is deprecated. This is mapped to
  ``test: native_and_emulated``.

**Fixed:**

* Always pull a new version of the image used in a build
* Add workaround for Travis CI network issues (courtesy of @pkgw)

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Marcel Bargull
* Matthew W. Thompson



v3.13.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added the ability to store conda build artifacts using the Github Actions provider. To enable, set `github_actions: {store_build_artifacts: true}` in conda-forge.yml.
* It is possible to set the lifetime of the Github Actions artifacts by setting the the `github_actions: {artifact_retention_days: 14}` setting in conda-forge.yml to the desired value. The default is 14 days.
* Support for ppc64le on drone CI has been added
* Added support for registering at a custom drone server by adding --drone-endpoint cli argument
* Added explicit check to not upload packages on PR builds.
* Added key ``github:tooling_branch_name`` to ``conda-forge.yml`` to enable
  setting the default branch for tooling repos.
* The linter will now warn if allowed ``pyXY`` selectors are used (e.g. ``py27``, ``py34``, ``py35``, ``py36``). For other versions (e.g. Python 3.8 would be ``py38``), these selectors are *silently ignored*  by ``conda-build``, so the linter will throw an error to prevent situations that might be tricky to debug. We recommend using ``py`` and integer comparison instead. Note that ``py2k`` and ``py3k`` are still allowed.
* Added support for self-hosted github actions runners

  In conda-forge.yml, add ``github_actions: self_hosted: true`` to
  enable self-hosted github actions runner. Note that self-hosted
  runners are currently configured to run only on push events
  and pull requests will not be built.

* Allow multiple providers per platform

  In conda-forge.yml, add ``provider: <platform>: ['ci_1', 'ci_2']``
  to configure multiple providers per platform.

**Changed:**

* Uploads are now allowed when building with ``mambabuild``!
* Azure build artifacts are now zipped before being uploaded, with some cache directories and the conda build/host/test environments removed, to make user download smaller and faster.
* A separate Azure build artifact, including only the conda build/host/test environments, is additionally created for failed builds.
* Azure artifact names are now only shortened (uniquely) when necessary to keep the name below 80 characters.
* Updated CircleCI xcode version to 13.0.0 to prevent failures.
* The conda-smithy git repo now uses ``main`` as the default branch.
* conda mambabuild is now the default build mode.  To opt out of this change set ``build_with_mambabuild`` to false in your ``conda-forge.yml``.
* Bump Windows ``base`` environment Python version to 3.9
* Support using ``build-locally.py`` natively on ``osx-arm64``.

**Fixed:**

* Azure artifact names are now unique when a job needs to be restarted (#1430).
* Azure artifact uploads for failed builds that failed because of broken symbolic links have now been fixed.
* Test suite now runs correctly on pyyaml 6
* Remove the miniforge installation before building with ``./build-locally.py`` on MacOS so that
  ``./build-locally.py`` can be run more than once without an error regarding an exisiting miniforge installation.

v3.12
====================

**Authors:**

* Marius van Niekerk



v3.12
====================

**Changed:**

* conda smithy init will now copy over the conda-forge.yml from the source recipe directory (if present)

**Authors:**

* Marius van Niekerk



v3.11.0
====================

**Added:**

* The maximum number of parallel jobs a feedstock can run at once will be limited
  to ``50``. This will ensure that all projects have a fair access to CI resources
  without job-hungry feedstocks hogging the build queue.

**Fixed:**

* Add --suppress-variables flag to conda-build command in Windows template

**Authors:**

* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra
* Billy K. Poon



v3.10.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Linting of recipes with multiple URLs was broken in last release and is fixed now

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando



v3.10.2
====================

**Added:**

* Add a "--feedstock_config" option to the regenerate/rerender, update-anaconda-token, azure-buildid subcommands for providing an alternative path to the feedstock configuration file (normally "conda-forge.yml"). This allows different names or to put the configuration outside the feedstock root.
* Linter will now check for duplicates of conda packages using pypi name
* Validate the value of ``noarch``. (Should be ``python`` or ``generic``.)

**Changed:**

* Use ``ubuntu-latest`` instead of ``ubuntu-16`` in the Azure pipeline template.

**Fixed:**

* `short_config_name` is used at azure pipelines artifact publishing step.
* Duplicate feedstocks with only '-' vs '_' difference is now correctly checked.
* correctly detect use of `test/script` in outputs

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Uwe L. Korn
* Ryan Volz
* Duncan Macleod
* fhoehle
* Ben Mares



v3.10.1
====================

**Added:**

* Allow osx builds in build-locally.py

**Changed:**

* Focal is now used for Linux builds on Travis CI

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker
* Chris Burr





v3.10.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `clone_depth` parameter for use in conda-forge.yml that sets the feedstock git clone depth for all providers (except CircleCI). By default (`clone_depth: none`), current behavior is maintained by using the provider's default checkout/clone settings. A full clone with no depth limit can be specified by setting `clone_depth: 0`.
* Log groups support for GitHub Actions
* Added support for Github Actions as a CI provider. Provider name to use in conda-forge.yml
  is `github_actions`. Note that Github Actions cannot be enabled as a CI provider for conda-forge
  github organization to prevent a denial of service for other infrastructure.
* Add instructions to feedstock README template for configuring strict channel priority.

**Changed:**

* The `ci-skeleton` command now creates a default conda-forge.yml that sets `clone_depth: 0` for full depth clones on all providers. This default supports expected behavior when using `GIT_DESCRIBE_*` to set version and build numbers in the recipe by ensuring that tags are present. This effectively changes the default clone behavior for the Github Action and Travis providers, as all other providers do a full clone by default.

**Fixed:**

* Prevent duplicated log group tags when ``set -x`` is enabled.
* Fix run_osx_build not failing early on setup error.
* Fix too long filenames for build done canary files.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra
* Ryan Volz
* Marcel Bargull
* Philippe Blain
* Matthew R. Becker
* Marcel Bargull



v3.9.0
====================

**Added:**

* Enabled multiple entries for ``key_add`` operations.
* Define Bash functions ``startgroup()`` and ``endgroup()`` that provide a
  provider-agnostic way to group or fold log lines for quicker visual inspection.
  In principle, this only affects Linux and MacOS, since Windows pipelines
  use CI native steps. So far, only Azure and Travis support this. In the other
  providers a fallback ``echo "<group name>"`` statement is supplied.
* Support `os_version` in `conda-forge.yml`
* Add use_local option to use the migrator from the feedstock

**Changed:**

* To cross compile for  ``win-32`` from ``win-64``, using ``target_platform``
  is no longer supported. Use ``build_platform: win_32: win64`` in ``conda-forge.yml``.
* `run_osx_build.sh` had hardcoded handlers for Travis log folding. These have
  been replaced with the now equivalent Bash functions.
* A lower bound on python version for noarch python is now required

**Fixed:**

* Fix "File name too long" error for many zip keys
  Replace config filenames by their short versions if filesystem limits
  are approached.
* Fix running ``./build-locally.py --debug`` with cross-compilation
* Fixed dead conda-docs link to the ``build/number`` explanation in the README template.
* Fixed rendering error where the recipe's ``conda_build_config.yaml`` is
  applied again, removing some variants.
* Fixed list formatting in the README.
* migration_ts and migrator_ts were both used in conda-smithy and migration_ts was removed in favour of migrator_ts

v3.8.6
====================

**Changed:**

* Run docker builds using ``delegated`` volume mounts.

**Fixed:**

* All keys zipped with ``docker_image`` are now handled properly.
* Changed CI configuration to not run tests on ``push`` events to branches that
  are not ``master``.
* CI runs on PRs from forks now.
* ``#`` is not a valid comment symbol on Windows and using it as part of a pipeline Batch step will cause a (harmless) error in the logs. It has been replaced by ``::`` instead.

**Security:**

* Use latest ``conda-incubator/setup-miniconda`` version to circumvent the GH Actions deprecations on Nov 16th

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R Becker
* Matthew R. Becker
* Uwe L. Korn
* John Kirkham
* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra



v3.8.5
====================

**Changed:**

* Moved CI to GitHub actions and removed travis-ci
* Use the shorter build ID instead of job ID to name Azure artifacts when they are stored. This helps prevent the artifact name from being too long, which would result in being unable to download it.
* Replaced travis-ci status badge w/ GitHub actions one.

**Fixed:**

* Faulty ``migrator_ts`` type check prevented manual migrations from happening (those that are not yet merged to ``conda-forge-pinning``).
* Previous release accidentally included a commit that made noarch: python
  recipes without a lower bound error. This was changed to a hint

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R. Becker
* Ryan Volz
* Marius van Niekerk
* Jaime Rodríguez-Guerra



v3.8.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* conda-build 3.20.5 compatibility for ``target_platform`` being always defined.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando



v3.8.3
====================

**Added:**

* conda-build 3.20.5 compatiblity
* New ``choco`` top-level key in ``conda-forge.yml`` enables windows builds
  to use chocolatey to install needed system packages. Currently, only Azure
  pipelines is supported.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Anthony Scopatz



v3.8.2

**Added:**

* Generate Documentation and Development links into the README.md based on doc_url and dev_url
* Add hyperlink to feedstock license file
* Generate license_url as hyperlink in the README.md when it has been defined in the meta.yaml
* Add ``--without-anaconda-token`` option to register-ci command, keep default behaviour of requiring the token
* ``remote_ci_setup`` field in conda-forge.yml, which defaults to ``conda-forge-ci-setup=3`` allowing the user to override

**Changed:**

* Variant algebra now supports two new operations for adding/remove a key

These new options allow for handling complex migrations cases needed for the python migrations.
* Add support to ``build-locall.py`` to call ``conda debug``.
* Added note about behaviour to README.md
* CI templates now expand ``remote_ci_setup`` string from config for the ci setup package

**Removed:**

* Remove unneeded set_defaults() for --without-$CI args, ``action="store_false"`` already defaults to True if not given

**Fixed:**

* Removed the warning for azure token when rerendering

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Johnny Willemsen
* Uwe L. Korn
* Tom Pollard
* Marius van Niekerk



v3.7.10
====================

* Remove unused ``forge_config["upload_script"]`` logic

**Fixed:**

* Error with linting check for deletion of ``recipes/example/meta.yaml`` in staged-recipes

**Authors:**

* Joshua L. Adelman
* Tom Pollard



v3.7.9
====================

**Added:**

* ``test_on_native_only`` is now supported on osx too.

**Deprecated:**

* Unparsed `"upload_packages": False` from default conda-forge.yml, as not parsed & no longer reflective of defaults

**Fixed:**

* re-enabled `upload_packages` per provider to conda-forge.yml, which when set to False overrides default upload logic

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Tom Pollard
* Joshua L. Adelman



v3.7.8
====================

**Added:**

* ``MACOSX_SDK_VERSION`` is added as an always used key

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando



v3.7.7
====================

**Added:**

* Publish conda build artifacts on Azure as pipeline artifacts when azure.store_build_artifacts flag is True in conda-forge.yml. The default is False.
* Add an option ``test_on_native_only`` to not run tests when cross compiling

**Changed:**

* Handle NameError when anaconda_token isn't defined in ci_register.py, inline with rotate_anaconda_token()
* MacOS image in CI is bumped to macOS 10.15

**Fixed:**

* Re add travis_wait support via idle_timeout_minutes

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Ryan Volz
* Tom Pollard



v3.7.6
====================

**Added:**

* Added partial support for cross compiling (Unixes can compile for other unixes only)

**Changed:**

* linux-64 configs were changed from prefix ``linux`` to ``linux-64``
* ``target_platform`` is now always defined for non-noarch  recipes
* Raise RuntimeError on empty travis repo_info requests, to guard against later KeyErrors
* Provide the name of the feedstock for which the update-anaconda-token command
  was performed.
* GitHub Teams are now added to feedstocks by their ``slug`` (i.e., the name
  used to ``@``-mention them on ``github.com``) as opposed to their names.

**Deprecated:**

* Setting ``provider: linux`` is deprecated in favor of ``provider: linux_64``

**Fixed:**

* Use `simplejson` to catch `JSONDecodeError` when available. Fix #1368.

**Security:**

* Members and teams are now properly removed from feedstocks and feedstock
  maintenance teams.

**Authors:**

* Isuru Fernando
* Matthew R Becker
* Matthew R. Becker
* Hadrien Mary
* Maksim Rakitin
* Tom Pollard



v3.7.4
====================

**Added:**

* Use the anaconda API to retrieve the latest version number of ``conda-smithy`` and ``conda-forge-pinning``.
* Pass ``CPU_COUNT`` from the host environment to the docker build.
  (Convenient when building locally.)
* Add a flag to `register-github` to create a private repository.
* Add a `private_upload` key in conda config file. If set to True Anaconda upload will use the `--private` flag.
* Removes ``/opt/ghc`` on Azure Linux images to free up space
* Additional secrets can be passed to the build by setting `secrets: ["BINSTAR_TOKEN", "ANOTHER_SECRET"]`
  in `conda-forge.yml`. These secrets are read from the CI configuration and
  then exposed as environment variables. To make them visible to build scripts,
  they need to be whitelisted in `build.script_env` of `meta.yaml`.
  This can, e.g., be used to collect coverage statistics during a build or test
  and upload them to sites such as coveralls.

**Changed:**

* Return type of ``feedstocks.clone_all()`` from ``None`` to list of repositories
* Link to list of SPDX licenses in lint message.

**Fixed:**

* Use ``AzureConfig`` in ``render_README`` instead of calling a raw requests. It allows rendering on a private Azure CI organization.
* CI skeleton properly sets the build number
* use SPDX identifier for feedstock license
* Allow an empty conda-forge.yml.
* The repo name for output validation is now extracted in the CI services to avoid
  issues with bad rerenders for clones to non-standard locations.

**Security:**

* Added --suppress-variables so that CI secrets cannot be leaked by conda-build into CI logs.

v3.7.3
====================

**Fixed:**

* Get feedstock name from meta when registering with CI services.
* CODEOWNERS file no longer treats GitHub team names as case-sensitive.

**Authors:**

* Matthew R Becker
* Uwe L. Korn

  and ``recipe/meta.yaml`` files for using conda-forge / conda-smithy as
  the CI configuration outside of configuration. Calling ``rerender`` after
  ``ci-skeleton`` will generate the configuration files. This is a great way to
  either bootstrap CI for a repo or continue to keep CI up-to-date.
  The ``recipe/meta.yaml`` that is generated is just a stub, and will need to
  be filled out for CI to properly build and test.

**Fixed:**

* The linter will now recomend fixes for malformed pins,
  suggesting a single space is inserted. For instance, both ``python>=3`` and
  ``python >= 3`` will ought to be ``python >=3``.
* New key ``upload_on_branch`` added to conda-forge.yml the value of which is checked
  against the current git branch and upload will be skipped if they are not equal.
  This is optional and an empty key skips the test.

====================

**Fixed:**

  These will be the new default behavior going forward for ppc64le builds.  If native builds are not needed the
  qemu based builds on azure will continue to function as before.
* Added `DOCKER_IMAGE` variable to `run_docker_build.sh`

**Changed:**

* Fallback to default image in `run_docker_build.sh` if `shyaml` is not installed.

    .. code-block:: yaml

    idle_timeout_minutes: 30
None

* Added preliminary multiarch builds for aarch64 and ppc64le using qemu on azure.  This will be enabled by
