  maintainers list is empty

**Changed:**

* Default windows provider was changed to azure.



v3.4.8

**Fixed:**

* Don't make assumptions in ``conda_smithy/variant_algebra.py`` about the metadata



v3.4.7
====================

**Added:**

* Added a method to sync user in drone

**Changed:**

* Check that a project is registered if registering fails on drone
* Check that a project has the secret if adding secret fails on drone



v3.4.6
====================

**Added:**

* conda-smithy can now register packages on drone.io.  We plan on using this to help out with the aarch64
  architecture builds.

**Changed:**

* drone.io is now the default platform for aarch64 builds
* migrations folder changed from <feedstock_root>/migrations to <feedstock_root>/.ci_support/migrations

**Fixed:**

* Fix render_README crash when azure api returns 404



v3.4.5
====================

**Fixed:**

* YAML ``dump()`` now used ``pathlib.Path`` object.



v3.4.4
====================

**Fixed:**

* Updated conda-smithy to work with ruamel.yaml v0.16+.



v3.4.3
====================

**Changed:**

* In linting pins allow more than one space

**Fixed:**

* Don't lint setting build number



v3.4.2
====================

**Added:**

* Generating feedstocks with support for the linux-armv7l platform.
* test of the downgrade functionality of the new pinning system
* Mark generated files as generated so that github collapses them by deafult in diffs.
* The linter will now recomend fixes for malformed pins,
  suggesting a single space is inserted. For instance, both ``python>=3`` and
  ``python >= 3`` will ought to be ``python >=3``.
* New key ``upload_on_branch`` added to conda-forge.yml the value of which is checked
  against the current git branch and upload will be skipped if they are not equal.
  This is optional and an empty key skips the test.
* Added `CONDA_SMITHY_LOGLEVEL` environment variable to change verbosity
  of rendering. This can be either `debug` or `info`.

**Changed:**

* Add skip_render option to conda-forge.yaml. One could specify one or more filenames telling conda-smithy to skip making change on them. Files that could skip rendering include .gitignore, .gitattributes, README.md and LICENCE.txt.
* Reduced verbosity of rendering

**Fixed:**

* recipe-lint compatibility with ruamel.yaml 0.16
* Mock PY_VER in recipe check
* Fixed badge rendering in readme template.
* yum_requirements will now work on Travis based linux builds.
* requirements: update to conda-build>=3.18.3
* fix non-public conda import, use conda.exports
* requirements: replace pycrypto with pycryptodome



v3.4.1
====================

**Added:**

* license_file is required for GPL, MIT, BSD, APACHE, PSF

**Changed:**

* ``build-locally.py`` now uses ``python3`` even if ``python`` is ``python2`` (Python 3.6+ was already required)

**Removed:**

* Github issue, PR and contributing files are removed as they are in https://github.com/conda-forge/.github
* Support for python 2 Removed

v3.3.7
====================

**Added:**

* Added codeowners file

**Fixed:**

* Fixed checking in .pyc files



v3.3.6
====================

**Fixed:**

* Indentation error in ``github.py``



v3.3.5
====================

**Added:**

* Added native aarch64 support for builds using Drone.io. This can be enabled by
  either using `provider: {linux_aarch64: drone}` or `provider: {linux_aarch64:
  native}` in the conda-forge.yml.
  
  Currently, drone has to be enabled manually as there is no automatic CI
  registration for repos.
* export CI env variable with CI provider name
* New ``build-locally.py`` script that is added to the root feedstock directory when
  ``conda smithy rerender`` is run. This script runs conda build locally. Currently
  it only fully supports running docker builds.
* print when adding new team to maintiners of feedstock

**Removed:**

* `docker.image` in conda-forge.yml is removed
* Removed the need for shyaml in CI env.

**Fixed:**

* removed empty lines causing current build status table to render as code
* build setup script overriding is now supported on azure too



v3.3.4
====================



v3.3.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added native ppc64le support to for travis-ci.  This can be enabled by either using
  `provider: {linux_ppc64le: travis}` or `provider: {linux_ppc64le: native}` in the conda-forge.yml.
  These will be the new default behavior going forward for ppc64le builds.  If native builds are not needed the 
  qemu based builds on azure will continue to function as before.
* Added `DOCKER_IMAGE` variable to `run_docker_build.sh`

**Changed:**

* Fallback to default image in `run_docker_build.sh` if `shyaml` is not installed.

**Fixed:**

* Fixed badges for noarch builds using azure



v3.3.2

**Fixed:**

* Use `config.instance_base_url` instead of `config.azure_team_instance` when creating new feedstocks



v3.3.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added a utility to retrieve the azure buildid.  This is needed to make badges for non-conda forge users.
* Added badges for azure ci builds.

**Changed:**

* Bumped up the maximum build time on azure to 6 hours!
* Switched default provider for osx and linux to be azure.
* ``conda-smithy regenerate`` now supports ``--check`` to see if regeneration can be performed
* Bumped the license year to 2019.
* Only suggest noarch in linting staged-recipes pull requests, not feedstocks.
  Refer to issues #1021, #1030, #1031. Linter is not checking all prerequisites for noarch.



v3.2.14

**Fixed:**

* yum_requirements will now work on azure based linux builds.



v3.2.12
====================

**Fixed:**

* Removed ``v`` from release that prevented conda-smithy version check from
  working properly.



v3.2.11
====================

**Fixed:**

* Secrets weren't getting passed to Azure properly.



v3.2.10
====================

**Changed:**

* Ran ``black`` on the codebase
* Added a few more always included keys.  These are required by the aarch64 migration.
These in particular are: ``cdt_arch``, ``cdt_name``,  ``BUILD``.



v3.2.9
====================



v3.2.8
====================

**Fixed:**

* conda-clean --lock does nothing.  Remove it.

v3.2.3
====================

**Added:**

* Added `conda-build` version to git commit message produced by `conda smithy regenerate`
* Made idle timeouts on travisci and circleci configurable.  To set this add to your `conda-forge-config.yml`

    .. code-block:: yaml

    idle_timeout_minutes: 30
None

* Added preliminary multiarch builds for aarch64 and ppc64le using qemu on azure.  This will be enabled by
means of a migrator at a later point in time.
Command line options are now available for the command `conda smithy register-ci`
to disable registration on a per-ci level. `--without-azure`, `--without-circle`,
`--without-travis`, and `--without-appveyor` can now be used in conjunction with
`conda smithy register-ci`.

**Changed:**

conda-build is now specified along side `conda-forge-ci-setup` installs so that it gets updated to the latest version available during each build.
* Moved NumFOCUS badge to "About conda-forge" section in the feedstock README.
* Removed ``branch2.0`` for the finding the fast-finish script, and changed it
  back to ``master``.

**Fixed:**

  (aka, I heard you like news, so I put a news item about adding news items into
  your news item, so you can add news while you add news)
* Feedstock maintainers are now listed in the README file.


**Removed:**

* Python 2.7 support has been dropped.  Conda-smithy now requires python >= 3.5.


**Fixed:**

* Fixes issue with Circle job definition where "filters are incompatible with
  workflows" when Linux is skipped. This was causing Linux jobs to be created
  and then fail on feedstocks where Linux and Circle were not needed.




v3.2.0
====================

**Changed:**

* updated toolchain lint to error


**Fixed:**

* The ``extra-admin-users`` flag can be None which is the default case. So, we have to check that before to make a loop on the entries of ``extra-admin-users`` list.
